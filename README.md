# Plain text rendering support for Last Mate

Rendering rules for plain text files in [Last Mate](https://github.com/jonruttan/last-mate).

Based on [atom/language-text](https://github.com/atom/language-text), which was originally [converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle)
from the [Text TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/text.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add renderers, make tweaks, etc.
